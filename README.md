## Disclaimer
This is a experimental fork of original itlwm. It implements kernel socket connection, allowing external client application to control hardware.

## Client Programs
* GUI: ~[itlwm-client](https://github.com/gimdh/itlwm-client)~  It does not work for now, due to permission issue.
* CLI: [itlwm-client-cli](https://github.com/gimdh/itlwm-client-cli)
